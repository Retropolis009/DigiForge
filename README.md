This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the primary database. The application demonstrates a complete shopping flow, including product browsing, user authentication, cart management, and order processing.

The backend serves as the single source of truth, handling all business logic, data persistence, and security-critical operations such as password hashing and order total calculations. The frontend is responsible solely for presenting data and interacting with the backend via RESTful APIs.
